Question for M Jan 2024:

-CBD in papers defined as 'for practical purposes', foliage plus 0-0.5 cm branchwood. Americans
(e.g. Reinhardt et al. 2006 - FuelCalc) also use this, suggesting foliage plus 1/2 of 1 hr load
size branchwood
But ICFME showed CFC of about 2x foliar FC. 
-But canopy fuel calculator only uses foliar FC. How to reconcile this?

-Ladder fuel calcs
Sapling calculations, e.g. defining LFC at crown centroid position - false SFC
Scaling actual SFC upward (thereby reducing FC value to something comparable to ladder false SFC)
Using a scaling equation to compare heat flux equivalent between live foliage and dead fuel
Adding together LfSFC and GfSFC

-If crown fire is predicted in lower cohort, but not predicted to involve upper canopy, consider
as passive midstory crown fire for spread rate purposes
