CanFIRE?

Q for Marty:
Cruz et al. 2005: "The CBD can be calculated directly (Cruz et al. 2003a), estimated (i.e., assigned 
nominal value from local knowledge), or inferred by other means (e.g., Riano et al. 2003; Keane et al. 2005; 
Scott and Reinhardt 2005)."

Cruz 2003a is IJWF article - canopy fuel stratum characteristics

"From the assumption that conifer needles are the main aerial fuel consumed within the flaming 
front of a crown fire, canopy fuel properties are based on the quantification of live needle 
foliage. Nevertheless, the authors recognize that, in certain fuel complexes, other fine fuels 
such as fine live and dead twigs, lichens and bark flakes might significantly contribute to the 
energy released within the zone of flaming combustion (Call and Albini 1997; Agee et al. 2002). 
No quantitative description of these fuels was available in the datasets/models used in this 
study, and consequently they were not included in the analysis."

Alexander et al. 2006 (CFIS conference paper):
"In practical terms the CBD is a function of the mass of needle foliage and small branchwood 
divided by the depth of the crown fuel layer which is in turn the difference between the stand 
height and the CBH (Cruz et al., 2003a)."

Alexander and Cruz (2016) - Crown fire dynamics paper
Box 4: "The CFL represents the quantity of crown fuel typically consumed in a crown fire,
principally needle foliage."
p. 191 "When a fire in a conifer forest stand crowns, additional fuel is consumed primarily 
in the form of needle foliage (Wendel 1960) but also mosses and lichens, bark flakes, and small 
woody twigs. Empirical data on the latter fuel component are limited to a single study (Stocks 
et al. 2004b)."

US (FuelCalc - Reinhardt et al. 2006)
"Available canopy fuel load — Available canopy fuel load is assumed to be all the foliage and 
one-half of the 0-.25” branch material in the stand. We use Brown’s (1978) equations for 
estimating the weight of foliage and small (0-1/4”) branchwood for each tree from species and 
diameter."
