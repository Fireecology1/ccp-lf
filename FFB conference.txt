Ladder fuels in conifer forests are recognized as a 'weak link' that can facilitate crown fire initiation; however, few techniques exist for estimating 
their influence on crown fire occurrence. In this study, we used a re-working of the well-known CE Van Wagner (1977) crown fire initiation model to 
derive an equivalency between surface fuel consumption (SFC) and consumption of elevated ladder fuels (LFC). The new model allows for a vertical 
rescaling of elevated fuels in order to include LFC in operational crown fire models. The rescaling model was tested and calibrated using Canadian 
experimental fire data showing a multiplier of about 3-4x. Thus, removing ladder fuel biomass and reducing LFC is approximately 3-4 times more 
effective for reducing crown fire occurrence than an equivalent reduction in SFC, even aside from the difference in vertical position and fuelbed 
characteristics. In an immature jack pine stand with abundant standing dead stems, ladder fuels appear about 6x more influential than surface fuels 
by mass. Despite its simplicity, the new model will help managers estimate the contribution of ladder fuels to crown fire potential and target 
mitigation treatments appropriately.
